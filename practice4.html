    <h3>C++</h3>
    <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language that is widely used for competitive programming. Data structure, and Algorithms, developing<br>
       operating Systems, etc.</p>

    <h1 style="color: red; font-style: italic;">Java</h1>
    <p>Java has been one amongst the foremost standard programming languages for several years. When compared with C++, Java codes are typically<br>
       additional reparable as a result of Java doesn't enable several things which can cause bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For<br>
       instance, non-primitives are references in Java.</p>
